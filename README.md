# Market Capitalization Prediction Project Based on Sales Using Apache Spark

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting market capitalization of companies based on their sales figures. We utilize Apache Spark for processing big data and apply machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Grid Search Regression to build predictive models. The project aims to enhance model accuracy and evaluate results using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- Data is gathered from publicly disclosed financial reports of listed companies.
- Apache Spark is employed to handle large datasets from diverse sources and preprocess them for machine learning models.

### 2. Data Preparation

- Data preprocessing involves handling missing values and standardizing data to fit machine learning model requirements.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

### 3. Model Building and Training

- Apply Linear Regression and Grid Search Regression to construct models predicting market capitalization.
- Optimize model parameters using Grid Search and Cross Validation to ensure optimal performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Assess model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
- Fine-tune models to improve accuracy and predictive capability.
